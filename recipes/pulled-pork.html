    <h3><em>A good Pulled Pork is just one of those comforting recipes we should all have stashed in our recipe book. This is the pulled pork recipe I’ve been using for years! I love how it’s incredibly easy yet incredibly delicious!</em></h3>
    
    <h2>Ingredients For Rub</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper (or a little more if you want it spicier)</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tbsp salt and 1 Tbsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients For Roast And Broth</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pound boneless pork shoulder roast (aka Boston Butt roast)</li>
        <li>2 cups apple juice</li>
        <li>2/3 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Worcestershire</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp liquid smoke</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups BBQ sauce</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together salt, pepper, brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Place roast in a baking dish and rub entire roast with dry rub mixture, pressing mixture over the roast. Cover roast with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator at least 2 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl combine apple juice, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire and liquid smoke.</li>
        <li>Place roast in a slow cooker, pour several tablespoons of the apple juice mixture over the top of the roast, then pour remaining mixture on the side of the roast (I do this so all the dry rub isn’t washed off the top). Cover slow cooker and cook on low heat 8 – 10 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove roast from slow cooker and shred (leave broth in slow cooker). Return shredded pork to slow cooker (in broth) and allow to cook on low 10 – 20 more minutes. Drain most of the broth from pork (I leave about 1/2 cup), pour in barbecue sauce and toss.</li>
        <li>Serve in buns with coleslaw to make pulled pork sandwiches.</li>
    </ol>
